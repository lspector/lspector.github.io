### Featured projects

- [lexicase.ai](https://lexicase.ai), a brief guide to lexicase selection. Lexicase selection considers individual training cases in different random orders, and therefore with different priorities, for each selection event.

- [Artificial Intelligence in the Liberal Arts](https://liberal-arts.ai), an initiative at Amherst College, exploring and facilitating multi-way interactions between work in artificial intelligence and work across the liberal arts.

- [Push Language Discourse](https://discourse.pushlanguage.org/), the [The PUSH Lab](https://lspector.github.io/push.html)'s Discourse site, on which selected posts are publicly accessible.

- [Interpush](https://lspector.github.io/interpush/), an online Push interpreter.

- [Parrondo's Paradox simulator](https://lspector.people.amherst.edu/parrondos-paradox), for exploring puzzles in game theory about how combinations of losing strategies can win.
